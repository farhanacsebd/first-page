        <h2>This is Rajshahi</h2>
        <p>Rajshahi was selected by the Dutch in the early 18th century as the site of a factory (trading post) and was constituted a municipality under the British in 1876. Now an industrial centre, it produces silk, matches, timber, and processed agricultural products. It has several public hospitals, dozens of private hospitals and clinics, the Varendra Research Museum, a sericulture (silk cultivation) institute, the University of Rajshahi (1953), and Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology (1986).

            To the northwest of Rajshahi lies the elevated and undulating Barind region; to the south is the high, well-drained Padma River valley; and a swampy depression drains the land in the immediate vicinity of the city. Among the chief crops in the area are rice, wheat, jute, and sugarcane. The region’s sericulture accounts for almost the entire silk output of Bangladesh. Cottage industries include weaving, metalworking and woodworking, and pottery. The region is believed to have formed part of the old Pundra (or Paundravardhana) kingdom, the country of the Pods, whose capital was at Mahasthan. Pop. (2001) 388,811; (2011) 449,756.
